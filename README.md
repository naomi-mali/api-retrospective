## Purpose and Strategy
Retrospective aims to provide a dedicated space for users to celebrate lifeâ€™s special moments, encouraging reflection and connection through the art of photography. This platform focuses on highlighting the experiences that shape our lives rather than sharing every mundane detail, allowing users to create a lasting legacy of their most treasured memories.

Designed to foster gratitude and enhance users' perspectives on life, Retrospective draws inspiration from my own Polaroid album, which is a replica of one my mother used to have when she was young. This project seeks to evoke comfort and a sense of nostalgia. The retro style of the platform pays homage to the past while offering a reliable and unique space for users to celebrate their lives.

By blending purpose with strategy, Retrospective not only serves as a digital gallery for cherished moments but also cultivates a supportive community where users can reflect on and share what truly matters.

---

### Permissions Class: *IsOwnerOrReadOnly*

*As a developer, I need to ensure that only content creators can modify or delete their posts, preserving content integrity and user privacy.*

**Implementation:**  
A permissions class called `IsOwnerOrReadOnly` was implemented to restrict edit and delete actions on retrospectives and comments to their respective creators. This class checks if the authenticated user is the creator of the content, allowing full access if they are, or limiting them to read-only access otherwise.

---

### Cloudinary Permissions for Service Account

**User Story:**  
*As a developer, I need to configure service account permissions on Cloudinary to ensure security and restrict access to only necessary resources.*

**Implementation:**  
Permissions were configured for Cloudinary service account interactions, ensuring secure image upload and retrieval functionality. The minimal permissions include:
- **Create:** Permission to upload user images to Cloudinary storage.
- **Read:** Permission to retrieve and display stored images on the platform.

-------

## Cloudinary

## Step 1: Sign Up for Cloudinary

1. **Create an Account**: Go to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and sign up for a free account.
2. **Get Your Credentials**: After signing up, navigate to your **Dashboard**. You will find your `API Key`, `API Secret`, and `Cloud Name` in the **Account Details** section.

## Step 2: Install Required Packages

Open your terminal and navigate to your Django project directory. Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

```
pip install django-cloudinary-storage  
pip install Pillow
```

- **cloudinary**: The official Cloudinary library for Python.
- **Pillow**: A Python Imaging Library for image processing.

## Step 3: Configure Django Settings

### Update `settings.py`

1. **Open your Django projectâ€™s `settings.py` file**.

2. **Add Cloudinary to Installed Apps**:

   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       'django.contrib.admin',
       'django.contrib.auth',
       'django.contrib.contenttypes',
       'django.contrib.sessions',
       'django.contrib.messages',
       'cloudinary_storage',
       'django.contrib.staticfiles',
       'cloudinary',
       'rest_framework',
       # Your other apps
   ]
   ```

3. **Add Cloudinary Configuration**:

   At the bottom of your `settings.py`, add the following lines to configure Cloudinary:

   ```python
   import os
   from pathlib import Path

   if os.path.exists('env.py'):
       import env  # This imports your environment variables

   CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
       'CLOUDINARY_URL': os.environ.get('CLOUDINARY_URL')
   }

   MEDIA_URL = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/<your_cloud_name>/media/'
   DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
   ```


### Create `env.py`

1. **Create an `env.py` File**: In the root directory of your Django project, create a new file called `env.py`:

   ```
  env.py
   ```

2. **Add Your Cloudinary Configuration**: Open the `env.py` file and add your Cloudinary credentials:

   ```
   import os

   os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = 'cloudinary://<API_KEY>:<API_SECRET>@2c9njk'  # Update with your Cloudinary credentials
   ```

   Replace `<API_KEY>`, `<API_SECRET>` with your actual credentials from Cloudinary.


## Step 4: Create a Model for Image Uploads

In one of your Django apps (e.g., `profiles` or `posts`), create a model to handle image uploads. For example:

### Create a Model

1. **Open your models file (e.g., `models.py`)**.

2. **Define the model**:

   ```python
   from django.db import models

   class Profile(models.Model):
         image = models.ImageField(
               upload_to='images/', default='../default_profile_mjfgzn'
               )
Here's a refined guide for deploying your application to Heroku, specifically tailored for a Django REST Framework project using Cloudinary for image storage:

---

   - Add the following configuration variables:
     - **SECRET_KEY**: (Your secret key)
     - **DATABASE_URL**: (This should already exist)
     - **ALLOWED_HOST**: (e.g., `your-heroku-app-name.herokuapp.com`)
     - **CLIENT_ORIGIN**: (URL for the client front-end React application that will be making requests to these APIs)
     - **CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV**: (Address of the local server used for previewing and testing UI during development)
     - **CLOUDINARY_URL**: (e.g., `cloudinary://<API_KEY>:<API_SECRET>@<CLOUD_NAME>`)
  
6. **Deploy the Application**:
   - Click on the **Deploy** tab.
   - Scroll down to **Connect to GitHub** and sign in/authorize when prompted.
