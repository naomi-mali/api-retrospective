## Purpose and Strategy
---
Retrospective aims to provide a dedicated space for users to celebrate lifeâ€™s special moments, encouraging reflection and connection through the art of photography. This platform focuses on highlighting the experiences that shape our lives rather than sharing every mundane detail, allowing users to create a lasting legacy of their most treasured memories.

Designed to foster gratitude and enhance users' perspectives on life, Retrospective draws inspiration from my own Polaroid album, which is a replica of one my mother used to have when she was young. This project seeks to evoke comfort and a sense of nostalgia. The retro style of the platform pays homage to the past while offering a reliable and unique space for users to celebrate their lives.

By blending purpose with strategy, Retrospective not only serves as a digital gallery for cherished moments but also cultivates a supportive community where users can reflect on and share what truly matters.

## Cloudinary
---

#### Step 1: Sign Up for Cloudinary

1. Create an Account: Go to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and sign up for a free account.
2. Get Your Credentials: After signing up, navigate to your **Dashboard**. You will find your `API Key`, `API Secret`, and `Cloud Name` in the **Account Details** section.

#### Step 2: Install Required Packages

Open your terminal and navigate to your Django project directory. Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

```
pip install django-cloudinary-storage  
pip install Pillow
```

- cloudinary: The official Cloudinary library for Python.
- Pillow: A Python Imaging Library for image processing.

## Step 3: Configure Django Settings

#### Update `settings.py`

1. Open your Django projectâ€™s `settings.py` file.

2. Add Cloudinary to Installed Apps:

   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       'django.contrib.admin',
       'django.contrib.auth',
       'django.contrib.contenttypes',
       'django.contrib.sessions',
       'django.contrib.messages',
       'cloudinary_storage',
       'django.contrib.staticfiles',
       'cloudinary',
       'rest_framework',
       # Your other apps
   ]
   ```

3. Add Cloudinary Configuration:

   At the bottom of your `settings.py`, add the following lines to configure Cloudinary:

   ```python
   import os
   from pathlib import Path

   if os.path.exists('env.py'):
       import env  # This imports your environment variables

   CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
       'CLOUDINARY_URL': os.environ.get('CLOUDINARY_URL')
   }

   MEDIA_URL = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/<your_cloud_name>/media/'
   DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
   ```


#### Create `env.py`

1. Create an `env.py` File**: In the root directory of your Django project, create a new file called `env.py`:

   ```
  env.py
   ```

2. Add Your Cloudinary Configuration**: Open the `env.py` file and add your Cloudinary credentials:

   ```
   import os

   os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = 'cloudinary://<API_KEY>:<API_SECRET>@2c9njk'  # Update with your Cloudinary credentials
   ```

   Replace `<API_KEY>`, `<API_SECRET>` with your actual credentials from Cloudinary.


## Step 4: Create a Model for Image Uploads

In one of your Django apps (e.g., `profiles` or `posts`), create a model to handle image uploads. For example:

### Create a Model

1. Open your models file (e.g., `models.py`).

2. Define the model:

   ```python
   from django.db import models

   class Profile(models.Model):
         image = models.ImageField(
               upload_to='images/', default='../default_profile_mjfgzn'
               )
Here's a refined guide for deploying your application to Heroku, specifically tailored for a Django REST Framework project using Cloudinary for image storage:
